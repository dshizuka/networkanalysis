##<u>Before you start</u>


###1. Install Rstudio

This workshop will use R as the base language for all computer exercises. I have made this site as user-friendly as possible, but it is good for you to have the basics of R under your belt before you embark on these lessons. 


###2. Install Packages

Run this code:
```{r, eval=F}
install.packages(c("igraph", "bipartite", "asnipe", "assortnet", "ggplot2", "ggmap", "rnetcarto", "ecodist", "igraphdata", "statnet", "RColorBrewer"))
```


###3. Download data

Go to [this link](https://dshizuka.github.io/network2018/NetworkWorkshop_SampleData.zip) and download the compressed data files. Save the file into a folder that you can remember. This will allow us to run some of the examples even if internet access fails.
