I'm posting two different types of tutorials. First, the "Basic Tutorials" are general lessons for understanding the basics of network analysis. The "Worked Examples" section are exercises based on published studies--e.g., re-creating the analysis or simulations. 

###[Brief Overview of Network Types in Ecology & Behavioral Ecology](networktypes.html)

* [Intro to Animal Social Networks](networktypes_socialnetworks.html)
* [Intro to Ecological Networks](networktypes_ecolnets.html)
* [Intro to Spatial Networks](networktypes_spatialnets.html)
