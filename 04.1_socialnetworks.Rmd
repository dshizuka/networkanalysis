Social networks describe the dynamics of social interactions and associations (edges) between individuals (nodes). Examples of the types of interactions/associations involved include direct interactions (e.g., aggression, grooming), co-membership in groups such as herds and flocks, or co-use of spatial locations (e.g., roosts, refuges). The analysis of such social networks can be used to understand the structure of societies, the dynamics of social structure across time and space, and the flow of information/disease/etc through these connections.
