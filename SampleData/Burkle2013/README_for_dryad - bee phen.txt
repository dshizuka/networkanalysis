bee species = the 109 bee species (genus_species) in our study.
Rob start = first activity day for each bee species from Robertson's studies.  Numbers are the day of the year.
Rob end = last day of activity for each bee species from Robertson's studies.
start now = first day of activity for each bee species in 2009/2010.
end now = last day of activity for each bee species in 2009/2010.

missing values (empty cells) indicate bee species that were locally extirpated, or those species that are active later in the year past the spring season.
