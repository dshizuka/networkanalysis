4. AN ECOLOGISTâ€™S GUIDE TO DIFFERENT NETWORK TYPES

There are dozens of different types of biological networks. I will focus on a few main types of networks here. For each network, it is particularly important to think about how nodes and edges are defined.

We will present three general types of networks that have been of particular interest for ecologists, each with particular challenges. After a brief overview, I highlight a few particular topics for each type of network.


4.1. Social networks
Social networks describe the dynamics of social interactions and associations (edges) between individuals (nodes). Examples of the types of interactions/associations involved include direct interactions (e.g., aggression, grooming), co-membership in groups such as herds and flocks, or co-use of spatial locations (e.g., roosts, refuges). The analysis of such social networks can be used to understand the structure of societies, the dynamics of social structure across time and space, and the flow of information/disease/etc through these connections.
